In this code I have implimented a priority Queue using linked list
1.class Node 
(it stores the data and the data of the next element in the queue)
class Queue
(in this class I have implimented the logic of the periority queues )
Enqueue function
(funtion to add the nodes to the queues)
Dequeue function
(function to delete a node which has the highest periority in the Queue this Queue is a max Queue so basically the first node has the highest periority )
Display function 
(funciton to display all the  nodes of the Queues)
